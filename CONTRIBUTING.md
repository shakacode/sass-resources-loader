# Contributing
This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions
Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

## Development
Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sass-resources-loader.git
```

To start development simply run:

```
yarn start
```

It will run linters, clear directory with previous build, create new build and run watchers to re-build on every change.

To develop your local version of module and use it in local test project use `yarn link`:

```
cd path/to/local/sass-resources-loader
yarn link

cd path/to/test-project
yarn link sass-resources-loader
```

It will create symlinks to your local `sass-resources-loader`, thus you don't have to reinstall it on every change.

### Build
To create a build run:

```
yarn run prerelease
```

It will do the same things as `yarn start`, but without activating watchers.

### Linting and Testing
To lint your code run:

```
yarn run lint
```

## Example
`sass-resources-loader` comes with [example](example) to demonstrate how to implement it.

## New Features

## Style
[Shakacode](https://github.com/shakacode) is trying to keep a standard style across its various projects, which can be found over in [eslint-config-shakacode](https://github.com/shakacode/style-guide-javascript). If you have a style change proposal, it should first be proposed there. If accepted, we will be happy to accept a PR to implement it here.
